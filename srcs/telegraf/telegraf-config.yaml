    # Telegraf Configuration
    #
    # Telegraf is entirely plugin driven. All metrics are gathered from the
    # declared inputs, and sent to the declared outputs.
    #
    # Plugins must be declared in here to be active.
    # To deactivate a plugin, comment out the name and any variables.
    #
    # Use 'telegraf -config telegraf.conf -test' to see what metrics a config
    # file would generate.
    #
    # Environment variables can be used anywhere in this config file, simply prepend
    # them with $. For strings the variable must be within quotes (ie, "$STR_VAR"),
    # for numbers and booleans they should be plain (ie, $INT_VAR, $BOOL_VAR)


    # Global tags can be specified here in key="value" format.

      ## Default data collection interval for all inputs
      interval = "10s"
      ## Rounds collection interval to 'interval'
      ## ie, if interval="10s" then always collect on :00, :10, :20, etc.
      round_interval = true

      ## Telegraf will send metrics to outputs in batches of at most
      ## metric_batch_size metrics.
      ## This controls the size of writes that Telegraf sends to output plugins.
      metric_batch_size = 1000

      ## For failed writes, telegraf will cache metric_buffer_limit metrics for each
      ## output, and will flush this buffer on a successful write. Oldest metrics
      ## are dropped first when this buffer fills.
      ## This buffer only fills when writes fail to output plugin(s).
      metric_buffer_limit = 10000

      ## Collection jitter is used to jitter the collection by a random amount.
      ## Each plugin will sleep for a random time within jitter before collecting.
      ## This can be used to avoid many plugins querying things like sysfs at the
      ## same time, which can have a measurable effect on the system.

      ## Default flushing interval for all outputs. Maximum flush_interval will be
      ## flush_interval + flush_jitter
      flush_interval = "10s"
      ## Jitter the flush interval by a random amount. This is primarily to avoid
      ## large write spikes for users running a large number of telegraf instances.
      ## ie, a jitter of 5s and interval 10s means flushes will happen every 10-15s
      flush_jitter = "0s"

      ## By default or when set to "0s", precision will be set to the same
      ## timestamp order as the collection interval, with the maximum being 1s.
      ##   ie, when interval = "10s", precision will be "1s"
      ##       when interval = "250ms", precision will be "1ms"
      ## Precision will NOT be used for service inputs. It is up to each individual
      ## service input to set the timestamp at the appropriate precision.
      ## Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s".

      ## Specify the log file name. The empty string means to log to stderr.

      ## If set to true, do no set the "host" tag in the telegraf agent.
